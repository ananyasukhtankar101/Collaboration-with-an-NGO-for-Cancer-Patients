The organisation, Shri Vardhman Jagruti Yuvak Mandal, commonly known as "Shri Mahavir Khichdi Ghar" caters to the needs of approx. 700 people every day. Along with food, donors distribute utensils, plastic ware, umbrellas, blankets and other useful items to make lives easier for these people. 
The queue starts at 7 am and distribution is over by 9am. The patients are free before the hospital opens its doors for them and the volunteers are free to commence their daily routine at work.
The group has also started distributing free medicines and helping with hospital bills to the extremely needy cases. Virubhai Gada, one of the key members, regularly visits the hospital to gather information about the cases and verify the genuineness of each case before financial aid is made available.
Cancer Awareness Program Objectives:
 - Create cancer awareness and remove the stigma and fear attached.
 - Help people recognize the early signs and symptoms of cancer, thus enabling them to seek treatment at an early stage.
 - Educate people about the key risk factors, since more than 30% of cancer cases could be prevented by modifying lifestyle or avoiding the risk factors.
 - Inform people about the importance of regular screening and check-ups.
 - Inform women about mammograms, clinical breast exam, breast self-exam and Pap smear tests to check for signs of cervical cancer.
